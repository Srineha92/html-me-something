                <h2 class="fruits">Peaches: Packed with potassium</h2>
                <p>Everyone knows that bananas boast high amounts of potassium, 
                but a small peaches have more of the essential mineral than one medium banana,
                boosting nerve and muscle health. The skins, in particular, are rich in
                antioxidants and insoluble fiber. And for those watching their weight,
                peaches are a healthy way to add sweetness to any diet. 
                Bake, broil, or poach them to create pies, cobblers, and other desserts.</p>

                <h2 class="fruits">Apples: Brain and heart healthy</h2>
                <p> 
                    One medium apple is low on calories (only 80!) but heavy on quertecin, 
                    a powerful antioxidant that protects brain cell degeneration, which can lead 
                    to Alzheimer’s disease. Adults who eat apples are less likely to develop high blood 
                    pressure, according to one study. Apples can also lower cholesterol and prevent colon 
                    cancer, as well as promote healthy teeth and weight loss. Don't forget to eat the skin,
                    too—it’s especially rich in disease-fighting compounds like flavonoids, which reduce the
                     risk of heart disease.

                <h2 class="fruits">Pomogranates: More antioxidents than red wine or green tea</h2>
                <p> Pomegranate juice has two to three times the antioxidant capacity of 
                   red wine or green tea, and is also a great source of potassium, which sustains
                 energy and controls high blood pressure. Research shows that drinking ¼ cup of 
                     pomegranate juice daily could improve cardiovascular health, lower cholesterol,
                      and help with erectile dysfunction. However, talk to your doctor before you drink 
                      regular amounts of pomegranate juice, as it can sometimes negatively interact with 
                      prescription drugs.</p>

                <a name="Grapefruits"></a>
                <h2 class="fruits">Grapefruits: Vitamin C power house</h2>
                <p> 
                   Although oranges are a great source of vitamin C, grapefruits pack a
                    bigger punch. Just half of a grapefruit contains nearly 50 percent of 
                    your daily vitamin C, as well as high levels of fiber, potassium, and 
                    vitamin A. Studies have suggested that grapefruit can alleviate the 
                    symptoms of arthritis and repair damaged or oily skin and hair. 
                    It’s little wonder that this delicious fruit is no longer just a 
                    breakfast staple.

                <h2 class="fruits">Blueberries: Anti-aging powerhouses</h2>
                <p>
                Long considered one of the beloved “superfoods,” these sweet treats 
                are tiny but mighty, loaded with antioxidants and vitamin C to help 
                fight disease, as well as anthocyanin, a pigment shown to boost
                brainpower. One study found that people who ate the greatest amount of
                this fruit were less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration, 
                the leading cause of blindness in older adults.
